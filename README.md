# SECURITY ANALYSIS OF IOT DEVICES

IoT (Internet of Things) is a new paradigm which provides a set of new
services for the next wave of technological innovations. IoT applications are
nearly limitless while enabling seamless integration of the cyber-world with
the physical world. However, despite the enormous efforts of standardization
bodies, alliances, industries, researchers and others, there are still numerous
problems to deal with in order to reach the full potential of IoT.
The main issue IoT devices face is security vulnerabilities. Even though
these IoT devices have inbuilt firewalls , the gateway(normally the home
router) which acts as in interface between the IoT device and the internet
are vulnerable and donâ€™t have inbuilt firewalls. As a result this project focuses
on writing a firewall for gateways like Arduino Uno to which IoT devices can
be connected. The key Idea behind writing a firewall in Arduino is , any
data being transferred to/from the IoT device will pass through the same.
